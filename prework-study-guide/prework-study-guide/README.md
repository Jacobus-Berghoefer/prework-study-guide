# <BootCamp-Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

- This guide was created to provide an outline of of BootCamp topics that will get students ready for the course.
- I built this project to gain exposure to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript at a base level so I can have experience on day 1 of BootCamp.
- This guide solves the hurdle of getting everything setup for BootCamp, and provides insight into some of the topics and how they will be taught.
- I learned how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git on a fundamental level that will provide a foundation for the BootCamp.
